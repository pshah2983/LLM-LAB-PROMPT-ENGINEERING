# Sample Query
# ======================
query:
  base: "How do I optimize inventory levels for a manufacturing facility with seasonal demand patterns?"
  context: |
    We are a mid-sized electronics manufacturer with:
    - 500 SKUs across 3 product lines
    - Demand peaks 40% higher in Q4 (holiday season)
    - Current inventory turnover ratio of 4.5
    - Warehouse capacity constraints of 10,000 square feet
    - Lead time from suppliers averaging 6 weeks

      {query}
      
      Think through this step-by-step:
      1. First, analyze the key factors affecting inventory decisions
      2. Then, identify the appropriate inventory model
      3. Next, explain how to calculate optimal levels
      4. Finally, provide implementation recommendations
      
      Show your reasoning for each step.
